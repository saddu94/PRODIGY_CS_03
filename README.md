# PRODIGY_CS_03

This project was developed as part of an internship at Prodigy InfoTech, leveraging various references and self-study. The focus was on creating a Password Complexity Checker tool using Python.

## Description

This cybersecurity project involved developing a Password Complexity Checker tool designed to analyze the strength of user-entered passwords. The tool evaluates passwords based on several criteria including the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, length, and special characters.

## Features

- **Password Strength Analysis:** Evaluates the strength of passwords based on multiple criteria.
- **Feedback:** Provides constructive feedback to help users create stronger passwords.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd PRODIGY_CS_03
   ```
3. **Run the Code:**
   ```sh
   python password_complexity_checker.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Password Analysis:**
  - Enter the password you wish to analyze.
  - The tool will evaluate the password strength based on the criteria set.
  - Receive feedback on how to improve the password's strength.

## Notes

- The tool uses multiple criteria to ensure a comprehensive analysis of password strength.
- Ensure that the Python environment is correctly set up to run the script.
